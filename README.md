# Using the internal language of toposes in algebraic geometry

Any scheme has its associated little and big Zariski toposes. These toposes
support an internal mathematical language which closely resembles the usual
formal language of mathematics, but is "local on the base scheme": For
example, from the internal perspective, the structure sheaf looks like an
ordinary local ring (instead of a sheaf of rings with local stalks) and vector
bundles look like ordinary free modules (instead of sheaves of modules
satisfying a local triviality condition). The translation of internal statements and
proofs is facilitated by an easy mechanical procedure.

We investigate how the internal language of the little Zariski topos
can be exploited to give simpler definitions and more conceptual
proofs of the basic notions and observations in algebraic geometry.
To this end, we build a dictionary relating internal and external notions and
demonstrate its utility by giving a simple proof of Grothendieck's generic
freeness lemma in full generality. We also employ this framework to state a
general transfer principle which relates modules with their induced quasicoherent
sheaves, to study the phenomenon that some
properties spread from points to open neighborhoods, and to compare general
notions of spectra.

We employ the big Zariski topos to set up the foundations of a synthetic account
of scheme theory. This account is similar to the synthetic account of
differential geometry, but has a distinct algebraic flavor. Central to the
theory is the notion of synthetic quasicoherence, which has no analog in
synthetic differential geometry. We also discuss how various common subtoposes
of the big Zariski topos can be described from the internal point of view and
derive explicit descriptions of the geometric theories which are
classified by the fppf and by the surjective topology.

No prior knowledge about topos theory or formal logic is assumed.
