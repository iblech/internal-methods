* Knowing which theory a topos classifies tells us what the points
  of the topos are. [Deligne's
  theorem](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/06VX) ensures that all the
  toposes which are in use in algebraic geometry have enough points, such that,
  for instance, for checking whether a morphism of sheaves is an epimorphism it
  suffices to check this on stalks. It's therefore useful to have an explicit
  description of the points.

* Knowing the points can help in proving that pushing forward along
  closed immersions is exact. See for instance [Gabber and Kelly's
  article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5782).

* Good for specifying maps between toposes?

* Good for knowing which axioms are satisfied internally
