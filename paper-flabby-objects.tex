\begin{abstract}
  We introduce a general notion of \emph{flabby objects} in elementary toposes
  and study its basic properties. In the special case of localic toposes, this
  notion reduces to the common notion of flabby sheaves, yielding a
  site-independent characterization of flabby sheaves. We use this notion to
  show that an internal notion of injective objects coincides with the
  corresponding external notion, in stark contrast with the situation for
  projective objects. As an application, we give internal characterizations of
  sheaf cohomology and show that higher direct images can be understood as
  internal cohomology.

\section{Flabby sheaves}

A sheaf~$F$ on a topological space (or locale)~$X$ is \emph{flabby} if and only
if all restriction maps~$F(X) \to F(U)$ are surjective. The following
properties of flabby sheaves render them fundamental to the theory of sheaf
cohomology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let~$(U_i)_i$ be an open covering of~$X$.
A sheaf~$F$ is flabby if and only if all of its restrictions~$F|_{U_i}$
are flabby as sheaves on~$U_i$.
\item Let~$f : X \to Y$ be a continuous map. If~$F$ is a flabby sheaf on~$X$,
then~$f_*(F)$ is a flabby sheaf on~$Y$.
\item[(3a)] Let~$0 \to F \to G \to H \to 0$ be a short exact sequence of sheaves of
modules. If~$F$ is flabby, then this sequence is also exact as a sequence of
presheaves.
\item[(3b)] Let~$0 \to F \to G \to H \to 0$ be a short exact sequence of sheaves of
modules. If~$F$ and~$H$ are flabby, then so is~$G$.
% XXX: more?
\item[(4a)] Any sheaf can be embedded into a flabby sheaf.
\item[(4b)] Any sheaf of modules can be embedded into a flabby sheaf of modules.
\end{enumerate}

Since we want to develop an analogous theory for flabby objects in elementary
toposes, it is worthwhile to analyze the logical and set-theoretic commitments
which are required to establish these properties. The standard proofs of
properties~(1),~(3a),~(3b) and~(4b) require Zorn's lemma to construct maximal
extensions of given sections. Properties~(2) and~(4a) can be verified purely
intuitionistically.

There is an alternative definition of flabbiness, to be introduced below, which
is equivalent to the usual one in presence of Zorn's lemma and which
requires different commitments: For the alternative definition,
properties~(1),~(3b) and~(4a) can be verified purely intuitionistically, and
property~(2) can be verified purely intuitionistically for open maps~$f$.

Both definitions can be generalized to yield notions of flabby objects in
elementary toposes; but for toposes which are not localic, the two resulting
notions will differ, and only the one induced by the alternative definition
can be characterized in the internal language. We therefore adapt in this paper the
alternative one as the official definition.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:flabby-sheaf}
A sheaf~$F$ on a topological space (or locale)~$X$ is \emph{flabby}
if and only if for all opens~$U$ and all sections~$s \in F(U)$, there is an
open covering~$X = \bigcup_i U_i$ such that, for all~$i$, the section~$s$ can
be extended to a section on~$U \cup U_i$.\end{defn}

If~$F$ is a flabby sheaf in the traditional sense, then~$F$ is obviously also
flabby in the sense of Definition~\ref{defn:flabby-sheaf} -- singleton
coverings will do. Conversely, let~$F$ be a flabby sheaf in the sense of
Definition~\ref{defn:flabby-sheaf}. Let~$s \in F(U)$ be a local section. Zorn's
lemma implies that there is a maximal extension~$s' \in F(U')$. By assumption,
there is an open covering~$X = \bigcup_i U_i$ such that, for all~$i$, the
section~$s'$ can be extended to~$U' \cup U_i$. Since~$s'$ is maximal, $U' \cup
U_i = U'$ for all~$i$. Therefore~$X = \bigcup_i U_i \subseteq U'$; hence~$s'$ is a
global section, as desired.

We remark that unlike the traditional definition of flabbiness,
Definition~\ref{defn:flabby-sheaf} exhibits flabbiness as a manifestly local
notion.


\section{Flabby sets}

We intend this section to be applied in the internal language of an elementary
topos. We will therefore reason purely intuitionistically. We
adopt the terminology of~\cite{XXX:benno} regarding subterminals and
subsingletons: A subset~$K \subseteq X$ is \emph{subterminal} if and only if any given
elements are equal ($\forall x,y \in K\_ x = y$), and it is a
\emph{subsingleton} if and only if there is an element~$x \in X$ such that~$K
\subseteq \{ x \}$. Any subsingleton is trivially subterminal, but the converse
might fail.

\begin{defn}A set~$X$ is \emph{flabby} if and only if any subterminal subset
of~$X$ is a subsingleton, that is, if and only if for any subset~$K \subseteq
X$ such that~$\forall x,y \in K\_ x = y$, there exists an element~$x \in X$
such that~$K \subseteq \{ x \}$.
\end{defn}

In the presence of the law of excluded middle, a set is flabby if and only if
it is inhabited. Let~$\P_{\leq 1}(X)$ be the set of subterminals of~$X$.

\begin{prop}A set~$X$ is flabby if and only if the canonical map~$X \to
\P_{\leq 1}(X)$ which sends an element~$x$ to the singleton set~$\{x\}$ is
final.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}By definition.\end{proof}

The set~$\P_{\leq 1}(X)$ of subterminals of $X$ can be interpreted as the set
of \emph{partially-defined elements} of $X$. In this view, the empty subset is
the maximally undefined element and a singleton is a maximally defined element.
A set is flabby if and only if any of its partially-defined elements can be
refined to an honest element.

\begin{defn}A set~$X$ is \emph{injective} if and only if, for any injection~$i
: A \to B$, any map~$f : A \to X$ can be extended to a map~$B \to X$.
An~$R$-module~$M$ is \emph{injective} if and only if, for any linear
injection~$i : A \to B$ between~$R$-modules, any linear map~$f : A \to M$ can
be extended to a linear map~$B \to X$.\end{defn}

In the presence of the law of excluded middle, a set is injective if and only
if it is inhabited. In the presence of the axiom of choice, an abelian group is
injective (as a~$\ZZ$-module) if and only if it is divisible. Injective sets
and modules have been intensively studied before~\cite{XXX}; the following
properties are well-known:

\begin{prop}\label{prop:basics-injective}
\begin{enumerate}
% Take care if numbering changes (referenced below)
\item Any set can be embedded into an injective set.
\item Any injective module is also injective as a set.
\item Assuming the axiom of choice, any module can be embedded into an
injective module.
\end{enumerate}\end{prop}

\begin{proof}\begin{enumerate}
\item One can check that, for instance, the full powerset~$\P(X)$ and the set of
subterminals~$\P_{\leq 1}(X)$ are each injective.~\cite{XXX}
\item The forgetful functor from modules to sets possesses a left exact left
adjoint. More explicitly, if~$i : A \to B$ is an injective map between sets and
if~$f : A \to M$ is an arbitrary map, then the induced map~$R\langle A \rangle
\to R\langle B \rangle$ between free modules is also injective, the given
map~$f$ lifts to a linear map~$R\langle A \rangle \to M$, and an
extension~$R\langle B \rangle \to M$ induces an extension~$B \to M$ of~$f$.
\item One verifies that any abelian group can be embedded into a divisible
abelian group. By the axiom of choice, divisible abelian groups are injective.
The result for modules over arbitrary rings then follows purely
formally~\cite{XXX}. \qedhere
\end{enumerate}\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:injective-flabby}
Any injective set is flabby.\end{prop}

\begin{proof}Let~$X$ be an injective set. Let~$K \subseteq X$ be a subterminal.
The inclusion~$f : K \to X$ extends along the injection~$K \to 1 = \{\star\}$
to a map~$1 \to X$. The unique image~$x$ of that map has the property that~$K
\subseteq \{x\}$.\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:enough-flabby-sets}
Any set can be embedded into a flabby set.\end{cor}

\begin{proof}Immediate by Proposition~\ref{prop:basics-injective}(1) and
Proposition~\ref{prop:injective-flabby}.\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:hom-flabby}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let~$I$ be an injective set. Let~$T$ be an arbitrary set. Then the
set~$I^T$ of maps from~$T$ to~$I$ is flabby.
\item Let~$I$ be an injective module. Let~$T$ be an arbitrary module. Then the
set~$\Hom_R(T,I)$ of linear maps from~$T$ to~$I$ is flabby.
\end{enumerate}\end{prop}

\begin{proof}We first cover the case of sets. Let~$K \subseteq I^T$ be a
subterminal. We consider the injectivity diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
  T' \ar[r]\ar[d] & T \ar@{-->}[ld] \\
  I
} \]
where~$T'$ is the subset~$\{ s \in T \,|\, \text{$K$ is inhabited} \} \subseteq T$ and the
solid vertical map sends~$s \in T'$ to~$g(s)$, where~$g$ is an arbitrary element
of~$K$. This association is well-defined. Since~$I$ is injective, a dotted lift
as indicated exists. If~$K$ is inhabited, this lift is an element of~$K$.

The same kind of argument applies to the case of modules. If~$K$ is a
subterminal of~$\Hom_R(T,I)$, we define~$T'$ to be the submodule
$\{ s \in I \,|\, \text{$s = 0$ or $K$ is inhabited} \}$ and consider the
analogous injectivity diagram, where the solid vertical map~$f : T' \to I$ is now
defined by cases: Let~$s \in T'$. If~$s = 0$, then we set~$f(s) = 0$; if~$K$ is
inhabited, then we set~$f(s) \defeq g(s)$, where~$g$ is an arbitrary element
of~$K$. This association is again well-defined, and a dotted lift yields the
desired element of~$\Hom_R(T,I)$.
\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prop:hom-flabby} can be used to give an alternative proof of
Proposition~\ref{prop:injective-flabby} and to generalize
Proposition~\ref{prop:injective-flabby} to modules: If~$I$ is an injective set,
then the set~$I^1 \cong I$ is flabby. If~$I$ is an injective module, then the
set~$\Hom_R(R,I) \cong I$ is flabby.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:set-of-extensions-flabby}
Let~$I$ be an injective set. Let~$i : A \to B$ be an injection.
Let~$f : A \to I$ be an arbitrary map. Then the set of extensions of~$f$ to~$B$
is flabby.\end{prop}

\begin{proof}Set~$X \defeq \{ \bar{f} \in I^B \,|\, \bar{f} \circ i =
f \}$. Let~$K \subseteq X$ be a subsingleton. We consider the injectivity diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
  i[A] \cup B' \ar@{^{(}->}[r]\ar[d]_g & B \ar@{-->}[ld] \\
  I
} \]
where~$B'$ is the set~$\{ s \in B \,|\, \text{$K$ is inhabited} \}$ and the solid
vertical arrow~$g$ is defined in the following way: Let~$s \in i[A] \cup B'$.
If~$s \in i[A]$, then we set~$g(s) \defeq f(a)$, where~$a \in A$ is an element such
that~$s = i(a)$. If~$s \in B'$, then we set~$g(s) \defeq \bar{f}(s)$,
where~$\bar{f}$ is any element of~$K$. These prescriptions determine a well-defined
map.

Since~$I$ is injective, there exists a dotted map rendering the diagram
commutative. This map is an element of~$X$. Furthermore, if~$K$ is inhabited,
then this map is an element of~$K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}Let~$0 \to M' \xra{i} M \xra{p} M'' \to 0$ be a short exact
sequence of modules. Let~$s \in M''$. If~$M'$ is flabby, then the set of
preimages of~$s$ under~$p$ is flabby.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}For the first statement, let~$X \defeq \{ u \in M \,|\, p(u) = s
\}$. Let~$K \subseteq X$ be a subterminal. Since~$p$ is surjective, there is a
preimage~$u_0 \in X$. The translated set~$K - u_0 \subseteq M$ is still a
subterminal, and its preimage under~$i$ is as well. Since~$M'$ is flabby, there
is an element~$v \in M'$ such that~$i^{-1}[K - u_0] \subseteq \{v\}$. We verify
that~$K \subseteq \{u_0 + i(v)\}$.

Thus let~$u \in K$ be given. Then~$p(u - u_0) = 0$, so by exactness the
set~$i^{-1}[K - u_0]$ is inhabited. It therefore contains~$v$. Thus~$i(v) \in K
- u_0$. Since~$K = \{u\}$, it follows that~$i(v) = u - u_0$, so~$u \in \{u_0 +
i(v)\}$ as claimed.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}Let~$0 \to M' \xra{i} M \xra{p} M'' \to 0$ be a short exact
sequence of modules. If~$M'$ and~$M''$ are flabby, so is~$M$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}Let~$K \subseteq M$ be a subterminal. Then its image~$p[K] \subseteq M''$
is a subterminal as well. Since~$M''$ is flabby, there is an element~$s \in
M''$ such that~$p[K] \subseteq \{ s \}$.

Since~$p$ is surjective, there is an element~$u_0 \in M$ such that~$p(u_0) =
s$.

The preimage~$i^{-1}[K - u_0] \subseteq M'$ is a subterminal. Since~$M'$ is
flabby, there exists an element~$v \in M'$ such that~$i^{-1}[K - u_0] \subseteq
\{v\}$.

Thus~$K \subseteq \{ u_0 + i(v) \}$.
\end{proof}


\section{Flabby objects}

\begin{defn}An object~$X$ of an elementary topos~$\E$ is \emph{flabby} if and
only if it is a flabby set from the point of view of the internal language
of~$\E$.\end{defn}

This definition amounts to the following: An object~$X$ of an elementary
topos~$\E$ is flabby if and only if, for any object~$A$ of~$\E$, the object~$X'
\defeq X \times A \in \E/A$ has the following property:
\begin{quote}
For any monomorphism~$K \to 1$ in~$\E/A$ and any morphism~$K \to X'$%
\tikz[remember picture] \node[coordinate,yshift=0.7em,xshift=1.0em] (n1) {};
in~$\E/A$, there exists an epimorphism~$B \to 1$ in~$\E/A$ and a morphism~$B
\to X'$ in~$\E/A$ such that the following diagram commutes.
\end{quote}
\[ \xymatrix{
  K \times_A B \ar[r]\ar[rd] & X' \times_A B \ar[r] & X' \\
  & B \ar[ru]
} \]
\tikz[remember picture] \node[coordinate,yshift=0.3em] (n2) {};
\begin{tikzpicture}[overlay,remember picture]
  \path (n2) -| node[coordinate] (n3) {} (n1);
  \draw[thick,decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=3pt}]
  (n1) -- (n3) node[midway, right=4pt] {$({\star})$};
\end{tikzpicture}

Instead of referencing arbitrary stages~$A \in \E$, one can also just reference
the generic stage: Let~$\P_{\leq1}(X)$ denote the \emph{object of subterminals}
of~$X$; this object is a certain suboject of~$\P(X) = [X,\Omega_\E]_\E$, the
powerobject of~$X$. The subobject~$K$ of~$\P_{\leq1}(X) \times X$ classified by the
evaluation morphism~$\P_{\leq1}(X) \times X \to \P(X) \times X \to \Omega_\E$
is the \emph{generic subterminal} of~$X$. The object~$X$ is flabby if and only
if there exists an epimorphism~$B \to \P_{\leq1}(X)$ and a morphism~$B \to X$
such that the following diagram commutes.
\[ \xymatrix{
  K \times_{\P_{\leq1}(X)} B \ar[r]\ar[rd] & X \times B \ar[r] & X \\
  & B \ar[ru]
} \]

\begin{prop}\label{prop:flabby-sheaves-objects}
Let~$F$ be a sheaf on a topological space~$X$ (or a locale).
Then~$F$ is flabby as a sheaf if and only if~$F$ is a flabby object of the
sheaf topos~$\Sh(X)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}It suffices to verify condition~$({\star})$ for stages of the
form~$A = \Hom(\cdot,U)$, where~$U$ is an open of~$X$. XXX
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}Let~$f : \E \to \F$ be an open geometric morphism between
elementary toposes. Let~$X \in \E$ be a flabby object. Then~$f_*(X)$ is flabby
as well.\end{prop}

\begin{proof}Without loss of generality, it suffices to verify
condition~$({\star})$ for the terminal stage~$A = 1$. Let~$k : K \to 1$ be a
monomorphism in~$\F$ and let~$x : K \to f_*(X)$ be an arbitrary morphism.
Then~$f^*(k) : f^*(K) \to 1$ is a monomorphism in~$\E$ and~$x^t : f^*(K) \to X$
is a morphism in~$\E$. Since~$X$ is flabby, there is an epimorphism~$B \to 1$
in~$\E$ and a morphism~$y : B \to X$ such that the morphism~$f^*(K) \times B \to X
\times B \to B$ factors over~$y$. XXX
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}An object~$I$ of an elementary topos~$\E$ is \emph{externally
injective} if and only if for any monomorphism~$A \to B$ in~$\E$, the canonical
map~$\Hom_\E(B,I) \to \Hom_\E(A,I)$ is surjective. It is \emph{internally
injective} if and only if for any monomorphism~$A \to B$ in~$\E$, the canonical
morphism~$[B,I] \to [A,I]$ between Hom objects is an epimorphism in~$\E$.
\end{defn}

If~$R$ is a ring in an elementary topos~$\E$, a similar definition can be given
for~$R$-modules in~$\E$, referring only to the set respectively the object of
linear maps. The condition for an object to be internally injective can be
rephrased in various ways. The following proposition lists five of these
conditions. The equivalence of the first four is due to
Harting~\cite{harting:XXX}.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:notions-of-internal-injectivity}
Let~$\E$ be an elementary topos. Then the following statements about an
object~$I \in \E$ are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $I$ is internally injective.
\item The functor~$[\cdot, I] : \E^\op \to \E$ maps monomorphisms in $\E$
to morphisms for which any global element of the target locally (after change of
base along an epimorphism) possesses a preimage.
\item For any morphism $p : A \to 1$ in $\E$, the object $p^*(I)$ has property~(1)
as an object of $\E/A$.
\item For any morphism $p : A \to 1$ in $\E$, the object $p^*(I)$ has property~(2)
as an object of $\E/A$.
\item From the point of view of the internal language of~$\E$, the object~$I$
is an injective set.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The implications ``(1)~$\Rightarrow$~(2)'', ``(3)~$\Rightarrow$~(4)'',
``(3)~$\Rightarrow$~(1)'', and ``(4)~$\Rightarrow$~(2)'' are trivial.

The equivalence ``(3)~$\Leftrightarrow$~(5)'' follows directly from the
interpretation rules of the stack semantics.

The implication ``(2)~$\Rightarrow$~(4)'' employs the
extra left adjoint $p_! : \E/A \to \E$ of $p^* : \E
\to \E/A$~(which maps an object~$(X \to A)$ to~$X$), as in the usual proof that
injective sheaves remain injective when
restricted to smaller open subsets: We have that $p_* \circ [\cdot, p^*(I)]_{\E/A}
\cong [\cdot, I]_\E \circ p_!$, the functor $p_!$ preserves monomorphisms, and one
can check that $p_*$ reflects the property that global elements locally possess
preimages. Details are in~\cite[Thm.~1.1]{harting}.\footnote{Harting formulates
the statement for abelian group objects, and has to assume that~$\E$ contains a
natural numbers object to ensure the existence of an abelian version of~$p_!$.}

The implication ``(4)~$\Rightarrow$~(3)'' follows by performing an extra change of
base, since any non-global element becomes a global element after a suitable
change of base.
\end{proof}

Let~$R$ be a ring in~$\E$. Then the analogue of
Proposition~\ref{prop:notions-of-internal-injectivity} holds for~$R$-modules
in~$\E$, if~$\E$ is assumed to have a natural numbers object. The extra
assumption is needed in order to construct the left adjoint~$p_! :
\Mod_{\E/A}(R \times A) \to \Mod_\E(R)$. Phrased in the internal language, this
adjoint maps a family~$(M_a)_{a \in A}$ of~$R$-modules to the direct
sum~$\bigoplus_{a \in A} M_a$.

% XXX: Explain construction. Show that p_! preserves monos.

Somewhat surprisingly, and in stark contrast with the situation for internally
projective objects (which are defined dually), internal injectivity coincides
with external injectivity for localic toposes.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:injectivity-external-internal}
Let~$I$ be an object of an elementary topos~$\E$. If~$I$ is externally
injective, then~$I$ is also internally injective. The converse holds if~$\E$ is
localic and Zorn's lemma is available.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}For the ``only if'' direction, let~$I$ be an object
which is externally injective. Then~$I$ satisfies Condition~(2) in
Proposition~\ref{prop:notions-of-internal-injectivity}, even without having to
pass to covers.

For the ``if'' direction, write~$\E = \Sh(X)$ and let~$I$ be an internally
injective object. Let~$i : A \to B$ be a monomorphism in~$\Sh(X)$ and let~$f :
A \to I$ be an arbitrary morphism. We want to show that there exists an
extension $B \to I$ of~$f$ along~$i$. To this end, we consider the sheaf of
such extensions, defined by the internal expression
\[ F \defeq \{ \bar{f} \in [B,I] \,|\, \bar{f} \circ i = f \}. \]
Global elements of~$F$ are extensions of the kind we are looking for.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:set-of-extensions-flabby}, this sheaf is a flabby
object and therefore by Proposition~\ref{prop:flabby-sheaves-objects} a flabby
sheaf. Zorn's lemma implies that~$F$ has a global element.
\end{proof}


\section{Characterizing cohomology}

% EXT, TOR
% Higher direct images


\section{Conclusion}

We originally set out to develop an intuitionistic account of Grothendieck's
sheaf cohomology. ƒåech methods can be carried out constructively, and
XXX(Barakat), but it appears that there is not a general framework for sheaf
cohomology which works in an intuitionistic metatheory.

The main obstacle preventing Grothendieck's theory to be interpreted
constructively is its reliance on injective resolutions. It is known that in
the absence of the axiom of choice, much less in a purely intuitionistic
context, there might not be any nontrivial injective abelian
group~\cite{blass:XXX}.

In principle, this problem could be remedied by employing flabby resolutions
instead of injective ones. There are, however, two problems with this
suggestion. Firstly, we needed Zorn's lemma to show that flabby sheaves are
acyclic for the global sections functor (Proposition~XXX); however, we noticed
the substitute property in XXX which might be good enough for further
developments. The more serious problem is that it is an open question whether
one can show, purely intuitionistically, that any sheaf of modules embeds into
a flabby sheaf of modules. The following is known about this problem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a purely intuitionistic proof that any sheaf of sets embeds into
a flabby sheaf of sets (Corollary~\ref{cor:enough-flabby-sets}).
\item The existence of enough flabby modules, and even the existence of enough
injective modules, is \emph{not} a constructive taboo, that is, they do not
entail a classical principle like the law of excluded middle or the principle
of omniscience. We know this since assuming the axiom of choice, any
Grothendieck topos has enough injective (and therefore flabby) modules. 
\item There is a way of embedding any module into a flabby module if one is
prepared to ignore set-theoretical difficulties. Namely, let~$M$ be an~$R$-module.
Inductively construct a collection~$T$ of terms by the following clauses: $0 \in T$;
if~$x,y \in T$, then~$x + y \in T$; if~$x \in T$ and~$r \in R$, then~$rx \in
T$; if~$x \in M$, then~$\underline{x} \in T$; if~$K \subseteq T$ is a
subterminal, then~$\varepsilon_K \in T$. Then~$T/{\sim}$, where~$({\sim})$ is
the finest equivalence relation such that the module axioms hold, such
that~$\underline{x+y} \sim \underline{x} + \underline{y}$, $\underline{rx} \sim
r \underline{x}$, $\underline{0} \sim 0$ and such that~$\varepsilon_{\{t\}} \sim
t$ for all terms~$t$, is a flabby~$R$-module into which~$M$ embeds.
\end{enumerate}

We currently believe that it is not possible to give a constructive account of
a global cohomology functor. However, XXX.
